# CircleCI Deployment Notifier

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/0ad62b4c5bea4e43a6b217664fecf639)](https://www.codacy.com?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=RobinDaugherty/circleci_deployment_notifier&utm_campaign=badger)

Sends deployment notifications based on deployments that occur on CircleCI.

Assumptions:

- Using CircleCI.
- Using Github.
- Using Slack for notifications.

You can also:

- Deploy releases that are tagged using Github Releases.

## Usage

Requires Ruby 2.0.0 or higher.

Add the following commands to your `circle.yml` deployment section:

```sh
gem install circleci_deployment_notifier
circleci_deployment_notify_slack -a "Application Name" -u "https://hooks.slack.com/services/WEBHOOK"
```

It's best to use environment variables for sensitive information list Slack webhook URLs.

So here's an example `circle.yml` deployment section that 
assumes you've set the environment variable `DEPLOYMENT_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`:
```yml
deployment:
  staging:
    branch: master
    commands:
    - # TODO: something to deploy the application to staging
    - gem install circleci_deployment_notifier
    - circleci_deployment_notify_slack -a "Application Staging" -u $DEPLOYMENT_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
  production:
    tag: /v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+/
    owner: MyOrganization
    commands:
    - # TODO: something to deploy the application to production
    - gem install circleci_deployment_notifier
    - circleci_deployment_notify_slack -a "Application Production" -u $DEPLOYMENT_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
```

That `production` section is designed to build and deploy for tags like "v1.0.0" that are created in
the fork of the repo that belongs to MyOrganization.
(So tags created in forks do not cause a build or deployment.)
See [CircleCI docs](https://circleci.com/docs/configuration/#tags) for more info.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## FAQ

### Why is this project built on Travis when it's specifically for CircleCI?

CircleCI does not support builds against multiple versions of Ruby, so for a tool like this, Travis
is a better fit.
This gem is for use by applications, where it will be built on a single version of Ruby and deployed
to staging and/or production infrastructure owned by the team.
